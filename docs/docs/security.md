## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in one of my projects, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT comment about the vulnerability publicly.**
2. Please email [`me@rdil.rocks`](mailto:me@rdil.rocks) with the following format:

    ```none
    Subject: (PROJECT NAME HERE) Security Risk

    Give exact details I can replicate it with.
    If anything else needs to be said, put it here.
    In cases of security risks, there is no such thing as
    too little information.
    ```

3. Please be patient. You will get an email back soon.

Thank you! :raised_hands:

## Project Statuses

If a project is marked as [Deprecated / Unstable](support-policy#deprecated-unsupported), I won't fix the issue unless it is critical, but will document that it exists for potential users of the project.

The reasoning behind this is that projects under that status are not being updated anymore, and should not be relied on.
