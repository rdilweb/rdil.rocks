title: Support Policy

This policy details how my different projects handle support, updates, and maintenance.

## Terms

### Active

Active means a project is being actively developed, or due to the nature of the project cannot be marked as [stable](#stable), but is "stable" in its current state.

### Stable

The project has reached a useable point, and may continue to receive feature updates as ideas are suggested. The project will also receive periodic updates for smaller things, such as dependency updates.

### Deprecated / Unsupported

This project has finished development and will not be getting any more updates in the future unless deemed necessary by me.

All of my archived projects can be found [on my GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rdil/) - I sometimes delete them from my GitHub if they aren't really used at all.

### Prototype

This project is currently a concept, an idea that has not been fully implemented/tested yet.

### Alpha

This project has just been finished, and is in the process of being tested before being pushed to production.

OR...

This project has just graduated from [prototype](#prototype), but is missing features/may work with obvious flaws pending fixes.

### Unclassified

One of the above classifiers has yet to be assigned.

## Priority

### By Request Type

All requests are ordered in a specific priority for me, so that I can triage based on what is important.

1. Security. Security is always my top priority, and comes above all else.
2. Usability. If an app has a problem with the UX/DX, this comes next.
3. Maintenance. Basic fixes are less important.

### By Project

If the project in question is large, it will have a higher priority then a side project for example.
