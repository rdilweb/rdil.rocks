`flask-rest-error-handling` takes a Flask application object, and configures it to output payloads on errors that look like this:

```json
{
    "status": false,
    "code": 404,
    "error": "404 Not Found: The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again."
}
```

## Usage

Here is an example app that uses it:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_rest_error_handling import setup_error_handling

app = Flask(__name__)

setup_error_handling(app)
# by default, it will handle these error codes:
# 401, 403, 404, 500
# but this can be customized by passing the `error_codes`
# keyword argument
```
