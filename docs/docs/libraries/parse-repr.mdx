A lightweight Python `__repr__` parser for JavaScript.

## Download

<span class="badge badge--success">npm Package</span> <a href="https://npmjs.com/package/parse-repr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parse-repr</a>

To install the library, run:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install parse-repr
```

## Usage

To use the library, you will first need to put this at the top of any Python files that you want to use the lowercase values in:

```javascript
// with es6+ import
import ParseRepr from "parse-repr"

// or, with require
var ParseRepr = require("parse-repr")
```

and that is basically it, you can now use it.

## API

### `constructor(repr: string)`

Basic constructor.

> **Argument** repr (string): The unparsed repr.
>
> **Throws `Error`**: If you don't pass a repr or pass undefined.

### `parse()`

Parses the repr. This is automatically called by the constructor and should only be called if you change the repr.

### `getObjectTypeName(): string`

Get the name of the object type (e.g. in "`<User me>`", the object type would be "User").

> **Returns**: The name of the object type

### `getUnparsedRepr(): string`

> **Returns**: The unparsed repr.

### `getParts(): string[]`

Get the repr parts. In the case your repr looks like "`<User 123456 Billy>`", `["123456", "Billy"]` would be returned.

In the case your repr looks like "`<User id=123456 firstName=Billy>`", `["id=123456", "firstName=Billy"]` would be returned.

If you want actual key-value pairs for this, see `getKeyValuePairs()`.

> **Returns**: The list of elements in the repr.

### `getKeyValuePairs(): KeyValueObjects`

Gives you an object with the key-value pairs named in the repr.

> **Returns**: An object as described above.
>
> **Throws `Error`**: If the repr doesn't use key-value pairs.

```typescript
interface KeyValueObjects {
    [key: string]: string
}
```
