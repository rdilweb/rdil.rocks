`lcpy`, or lowercase values in Python, is a simple library that allows you to use values like `true` instead of `True`.
I created this when I was teaching a student Python who kept forgetting to put in proper uppercase letters.
It is super simple, and has very few drawbacks.

## Download

<span class="badge badge--success">PyPI Package</span> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/lc-py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lc-py</a>

The name of the package on PyPI is `lc-py`. (Sorry, `lcpy` was already taken!)

## Usage

To use the library, you will first need to put this at the top of any Python files that you want to use the lowercase values in:

```python
from lcpy import *
```

and that is basically it, you can now use it.

### Single-imports

Some static analysis tools don't enjoy it when you use `*` imports.
You can import single values by doing:

```python
# replace false with the value you want
from lcpy import false
```

## Values

If you read the [usage section](#usage) and now have a basic understanding, here are the values you can use:

-   `true`
-   `false`
-   `none`
-   `exception` (**new** in v1.1.0)

The following values can only be used in `v2.0.0` and above:

-   `indexerror`
-   `environmenterror`
-   `eoferror`
-   `oserror`
-   `processlookuperror`
-   `fileexistserror`
-   `filenotfounderror`
-   `floatingpointerror`
-   `recursionerror`
-   `referenceerror`
-   `runtimeerror`
-   `arithmeticerror`
-   `assertionerror`
-   `attributeerror`
-   `baseexception`
-   `blockingioerror`
-   `brokenpipeerror`
-   `buffererror`
-   `childprocesserror`
-   `connectionabortederror`
-   `connectionrefusederror`
-   `connectionreseterror`
-   `interruptederror`
-   `isadirectoryerror`
-   `ioerror`
-   `importerror`
-   `indentationerror`
-   `keyerror`
-   `lookuperror`
-   `modulenotfounderror`
