## Usage

Add the following lines to your mkdocs.yml:

```yaml
plugins:
    - search
    - progress

:::warning Remember to re-add the search plugin

If you have no plugins entry in your config file yet, you'll likely also want to add the search plugin. MkDocs enables it by default if there is no plugins entry set.
