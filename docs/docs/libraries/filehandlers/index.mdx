`filehandlers` is a library for working with files.

## Download

<span class="badge badge--success">PyPI Package</span> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/filehandlers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filehandlers</a>

## Concept

filehandlers is built on a simple model.

### File

A file is represented with an instance of `filehandlers.AbstractFile`.

:::tip Initializing an `AbstractFile`

The file doesn't need to exist when creating an instance of `AbstractFile`.

:::

### Manipulation

Now, say you want to change that file... that is where `filehandlers.FileManipulator` comes in.
You need to pass the `AbstractFile` instance when creating a `FileManipulator` so filehandlers knows exactly
which file it is controlling.

The manipulator includes code for a number of common functions that you may find handy.

### Simple Example

Here is a quick example that shows how to use filehandlers to write to a file:

```python
from filehandlers import FileManipulator, AbstractFile

# define the file
my_cool_file = AbstractFile("log.txt")

# create FileManipulator
my_cool_files_changer = FileManipulator(my_cool_file)

# write data to file 5 times
for i in range(5):
    my_cool_files_changer.write_to_file("Message #" + i + ": " + debug_message)
```

You can see the full API documentation [here](./api.md).
