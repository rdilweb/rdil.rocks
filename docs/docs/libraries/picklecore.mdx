PickleCore is a Jekyll theme developed by me ([for my website](https://rdil.rocks)) and [Param Thakkar](https://param.me/).

v1.0.0 was released, and documentation will not be written because it is no longer used by me.
It is relatively easy to look at the code and see how the theme works and can be configured.
