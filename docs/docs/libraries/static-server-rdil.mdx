A simple static web server.

:::info Reece, why should I use this one over any of the others?

This is a fair question. As of checking on January 10th 2020, there
are 68 pages of results for searching 'static server' on npm. This
static server has many features, including (but not limited to):

* It has emojis.
* It automatically renders Markdown into HTML.
* It has a lot of customizable components (such as the last two features!).
* All production code is run through [Babel](https://babeljs.io).
* It is still being actively developed.
