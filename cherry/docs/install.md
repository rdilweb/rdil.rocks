:::important Release Codenames

All Cherry releases are split into categories based on codenames, which include the following:

- Oak: Minecraft 1.14.4

**Make sure to get the correct version!**

:::

**First**, Download Fabric loader. Head [here](https://fabricmc.net/use), click Download Installer, run the installer, and install the profile for the Minecraft version that you want (must match the Cherry Minecraft version).

**Next**, Download Cherry. Choose a version:

[_Oak_ (Minecraft 1.14.4)](https://github.com/RDIL/Cherry/releases/download/1.2.0/CherryClient-Oak-1.2.0.jar)

**Lastly**, add the downloaded Cherry jar file to your `.minecraft/mods` folder. Launch your game with the Fabric loader profile, and Cherry should launch!
