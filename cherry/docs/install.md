:::important Release Codenames

All Cherry releases are split into categories based on codenames, which include the following:

- Oak: Minecraft 1.14.4
- Willow: Minecraft 1.15.2
- Maple: Minecraft 20w14infinite (NOTE: since Maple is a snapshot, it is no longer maintained as of 1.3.0)
- Pine: Minecraft 1.16.2 (should work with 1.16.3)

**Make sure to get the correct version!**

:::

**First**, Download Fabric loader. Head [here](https://fabricmc.net/use), click Download Installer, run the installer, and install the profile for the Minecraft version that you want (must match the Cherry Minecraft version).

**Next**, Download Cherry. Choose a version:

[_Oak_ (Minecraft 1.14.4)](https://github.com/RDIL/Cherry/releases/download/1.3.0/Cherry-Oak-1.3.0.jar)
[_Willow_ (Minecraft 1.15.2)](https://github.com/RDIL/Cherry/releases/download/1.3.0/Cherry-Willow-1.3.0.jar)
[_Maple_ (Minecraft 20w14infinite)](https://github.com/RDIL/Cherry/releases/download/1.3.0/Cherry-Maple-1.3.0.jar)
[_Pine_ (Minecraft 1.16.2+)](https://github.com/RDIL/Cherry/releases/download/1.3.0/Cherry-Pine-1.3.0.jar)

**Lastly**, add the downloaded Cherry jar file to your `.minecraft/mods` folder. Launch your game with the Fabric loader profile, and Cherry should launch!
